# PolyDocs
PolyDocs is a Streamlit application that enables users to interactively chat with the contents of their PDF files using advanced AI models. This app leverages Google Generative AI for embedding and querying, allowing detailed and context-aware question-answering from PDF documents.

## Features
- Upload Multiple PDFs: Easily upload multiple PDF files for processing.
- Intelligent Text Extraction: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs efficiently.
- Context-Aware Question Answering: Ask questions about the content of your PDFs and receive detailed answers.
- Interactive User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
- Persistent Vector Store: Stores embeddings of text chunks locally using FAISS for fast similarity search.
## Demo
A demo of the app can be found here: [PolyDocs Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shubhendu-ghosh/polydocs)

## Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

## Code Overview
app.py
- **Imports and Configuration: Sets up necessary imports and configures the Google Generative AI API key.**
- **Helper Functions:**
  - get_pdf_text(pdf_docs): Extracts text from the uploaded PDF files.
  - get_text_chunks(text): Splits the extracted text into manageable chunks.
  - get_vector_store(text_chunks): Creates and saves a FAISS vector store from the text chunks.
  - get_conversational_chain(): Sets up the conversational chain using a custom prompt template.
  - user_input(user_question): Processes the user's question by querying the FAISS index and generating a response.
  - Main Function: Manages the user interface, handles file uploads, and processes user input.
